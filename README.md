# NFT Fund

**_If you decided to make this into a protocol, hmu. I'm open to advising/developing it <3_**

## Foreword

There are hedge funds that deal with ERC-20 tokens, such as STFX + DHedge, but there aren't any for NFTs, yet! The closest thing to this would be PartyDAO's PartyBid. However, that's for bidding collectively on a single token. I image a protocol where you have a fund manager to make calls on trading NFTs. NFT trading is an entirely different realm to ERC-20 trading and there are people that specialise in it that make bank. This protocol aims to enable those NFT traders to utilise other people's money to make stronger plays while simultaneously benefitting the investor and the trader (manager).
